0x1234 0001 0010  0011 0100

The most bits we need to store at once is 16.

The most bits that need to be read at one time is 8 bits, but they could be between bytes. 0000 0001  1111 1110

When reading 1 bit at a time, once we get to this position: 0000 0000  1111 1111
The "current byte" should be shifted to the left byte, and the next needed byte should be moved into the second byte's spot if !feof.


if you do 
writer.current_byte >> (8 - (8 - writer.num_bits_left)) & 0xff >> ( 8 - ( 8 - writer.num_bits_left)), you will get the current_bits
